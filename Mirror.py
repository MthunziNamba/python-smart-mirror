Python Smart Mirror Display Software
Joshua Utting
24/10/2019

This code controls the display and updating for my version of a smart mirror. This is the public version and as such my APIs have
been removed and my personal information has as well so the code will not run as is. Anywhere that you need an API filling in will be
marked with this style of comment. Read the README file for info about what has changed from my functioning version so you know how 
to customise this code if you want to use it. The features in this code are as follows: time [top left], date [2nd from top left],
weather [center left], news [bottom left], face recognition switching display [top right], events list [bottom right]. For the voice
control a seperate instance of Launch.py needs to be ran, that code is unchanged so the voice recognition will work on running, see
those files for details. An API has been removed from the weather function which you can replace with a free API for current weather
from openweathermap.org, the login details have been removed from user2's facial recognition function but the code to see how it 
would have otherwise worked has been left in incase someone wants to run something similar. I have also omitted the livescore because
it had one or two display errors whihch I think I have fixed but not yet able to test until a game is played.
